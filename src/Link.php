/**
 * The Link Object represents a possible design-time link for a response. The

 * invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism
 * between responses and other operations.
 *
 * Unlike _dynamic_ links (i.e. links provided in the response payload), the OAS
 * linking mechanism does not require link information in the runtime response.
 *
 * For computing links and providing instructions to execute them, a runtime
 * expression is used for accessing values in an operation and using them
 * as parameters while invoking the linked operation.
